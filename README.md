## Development Process

### Highlights
* Highlights of the website are the simplistic UI and the functionality that gives the user a pleasant user experience.
* The website is easy to understand and navigate.

### Challenges
* I did have some issues wrapping my head around how to debug this website as it was my first time using MongoDB
* The main problem I had was that there were a few different files in the server and the front-end talking to each other and I wasn't always sure where the errors came from, but after playing around with it for a few hours, I was able to figure it out

## Future Implementations

* I would like to add image uploading to dynamically pull in the images with the rest of the product information
* I would like to add cart functionality so that the user can add items to the cart and view them in the checkout
* I would like to improve the UI more to make it more interactive and engaging
